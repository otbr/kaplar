## About
This is hobby project. I'm aiming to remake the original OpenTibia server (client version not yet decided) using C, XML, and Lua languages extensively. As the original project kept introducing features but in some cases not properly implementing them (which made the code base somewhat inconsistent), i felt i could try to remake the whole thing from scratch, optimizing and improving the functionality on the way.

## License
I chose the MIT License because it is a simple permissive license.
Refer to LICENSE inside the project directory for details.
